    "In this section, we put everything we learned in previous sections into practice by creating an LLM agent that will answer user questions about a hospital. To do that we use two datasources: a Neo4J vector indices that contain documents on user reviews of different hospitals and a Neo4J graph database containing information about those hospitals, visits, doctors, payments, etc. Our RAG pipeline will correctly re-direct the user query to each datasource and will answer the question in the end.
