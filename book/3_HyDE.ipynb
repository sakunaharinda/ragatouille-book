The intution behind generating such hypothetical documents is their embedding vectors can be used to identify a neighborhood in the corpus embedding space where similar real documents are retrieved based on vector similarity. In that case, RAG will be able to retrieve more relevant documents based on the hypothetical documents to answer the user query accurately. \n",

       "\"Low Rank Adapters (LRAs) are a recent development in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) that aim to reduce the computational and memory requirements of these models while maintaining their performance. The fundamental principle behind LRAs is the use of low-rank approximations to reduce the dimensionality of the model's parameters.\\n\\nIn the context of LLMs, an adapter is a small neural network that is inserted between the layers of a pre-trained model. The purpose of this adapter is to adapt the pre-trained model to a new task without modifying the original parameters of the model. This allows for efficient transfer learning, as the pre-trained model can be adapted to a wide range of tasks with minimal computational cost.\\n\\nLow Rank Adapters take this concept a step further by using low-rank approximations to reduce the number of parameters in the adapter. This is achieved by decomposing the weight matrix of the adapter into two low-rank matrices. The resulting model has fewer parameters and thus requires less memory and computational resources.\\n\\nDespite the reduction in parameters, LRAs have been shown to maintain the performance of the original model. This is because the low-rank approximation captures the most important features of the data, and these features are sufficient to achieve high performance on the task.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Low Rank Adapters work in LLMs by using low-rank approximations to reduce the number of parameters in the model. This allows for efficient transfer learning and reduces the computational and memory requirements of the model. Despite the reduction in parameters, LRAs maintain the performance of the original model, making them a promising approach for large-scale language modeling tasks.\""
